Widget that displays posts as a carousel, using jQuery. It preloads a few posts and Ajax is used to load more posts as the carousel advances.

== Description ==

With Ajax Post Carousel you can display posts as a carousel using jQuery for animations. The widget only preloads a few posts and Ajax is used to load more posts as the carousel advances (this is very useful when you have hundreds of posts).

The featured thumbnail of each post is used for the carousel, so at least Wordpress 2.9 is required. The widget can be totally customized using CSS. Only the basic styles are defined so the carousel works properly.

**Features**

* Posts can be selected from a category, a custom taxonomy or a post type.
* Number of posts in carousel and number of preloaded posts (buffered posts)
* Posts can be loaded in radom order or using the deafault order (From most recent to oldest)
* Carousel can be circular (no start or end)

1. Upload `ajax-post-carousel` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
